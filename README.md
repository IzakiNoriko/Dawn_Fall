# Dawn_Fall
This is a development version of Dawn Fall. Original program from https://github.com/IzakiNoriko/Dawn_Fall.

I have modified the Dawn Fall .dll and .ini for compatability with genshin, and turned on most of the features of the Dawn Fall plugin. 

I update the features of this program from time to time, so check back at https://github.com/SilentNightSound/GI-Model-Importer to see if there are any updates.

Place any mods created in the Mods folder and press F10 in game in order to load them.
